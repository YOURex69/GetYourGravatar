	<p>Gravatar (a portmanteau of globally recognized avatar) is a service for providing globally unique avatars and was created by Tom Preston-Werner. Since 2007, it has been owned by Automattic, having integrated it into their WordPress.com blogging platform.</p>
	<p>On Gravatar, users can register an account based on their email address, and upload a digital avatar to be associated with the account. Gravatar plugins are available for popular blogging software; when the user posts a comment on such a blog that requires an email address, the blogging software checks whether that email address has an associated avatar at Gravatar. If so, the Gravatar is shown along with the comment. Gravatar support is provided natively in WordPress as of v2.5 and in web based project management application Redmine beginning with version 0.8. Support for Gravatar is also provided via third-party modules for web content management systems such as Drupal and MODX.</p>
	<p><h2 id="heading2">History</h2></p>
    <p>For some time, the Gravatar service remained unmaintained. The maker became busy with working on a new version of the service, as Gravatar's popularity grew and more bandwidth was required. On 16 February 2007, "Gravatar 2.0" was launched. Besides an improved server script, users also noticed other improvements, such as being able to crop and use an image already hosted on the web. Support for two gravatars per account was added, between which the user can easily switch. "Gravatar Premium" was also launched, allowing unlimited email addresses and Gravatars per account.</p>
